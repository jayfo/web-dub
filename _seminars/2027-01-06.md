  There is no DUB Seminar this week.

  The DUB community has always been grassroots,
  constructed by all of us pursuing Human Computer Interaction & Design in and around the University of Washington.
  This week is focused on coordination and planning within the DUB community.

  - This faculty meeting is open to DUB faculty
    and University of Washington faculty interested in learning more about DUB.

  - Agenda will often be announced on the [dub-faculty mailing list](https://dub.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/dub-faculty), 
    but much of the meeting is also dedicated to communication within the DUB community.

#   The DUB Faculty Meeting and DUB Small Group Mixers focus on communication and networking within the DUB community.
#   These are currently hybrid, with each small group either virtual or in-person. 
# 
#   Mixers for {{ page.date | date: '%B %e, %Y' }} are being organized in this document:
#

# 
#   ### Introduction to DUB Small Group Mixers
# 
#   Instead of a seminar speaker, we hold a DUB faculty meeting and 
#   coordinate small group mixers that can include an in-person lunch reimbursement.
# 
#   #### 1) DUB Faculty Meeting
# 
#   The DUB faculty meeting is held at 12:00 in CSE 691 (i.e., Gates Commons).
#   Lunch is provided.
#   When there are clear agenda items, those will be announced on the dub-faculty mailing list.
# 
#   #### 2) DUB Small Group Mixers
# 
#   DUB Small Group Mixers are intended to be lightweight and grassroot opportunities for staying connected.
#   The heart of the DUB community is our diversity of perspectives,
#   bringing together people and ideas that might otherwise be hidden in our units.
#   Any member of the DUB community can and should host a mixer.
#   We expect mixers to require little or no advance preparation.
#   Participants may declare a topic of interest for a mixer, or they may decide to just connect and socialize.
# 
#   We aim to support both virtual and in-person mixers, 
#   and we can help support in-person mixers through reimbursement of an associated lunch.
# 
#   _Virtual Mixers_
#   
#   To host a virtual mixer, use the organizing document to provide a Zoom link.
#   As you decide whether to join an existing virtual mixer or start a new virtual mixer,
#   be mindful of the virtual format and how many people can effectively participate in a given mixer.
#   This will vary according to the plan for any mixer, so use your best judgment.
# 
#   _In-Person Mixers and Lunch Reimbursement_
# 
#   To host an in-person mixer, use the organizing document to suggest a location and format.
#   Because of our current distributed nature, we do not expect in-person activities are necessarily at campus.
# 
#   In-person small group mixers can receive lunch reimbursement according to this process:
# 
#   - Sign up to organize a small group mixer lunch,
#     including committing to coordinating a single reimbursement for the small group.
#     Note reimbursement is limited to approximately $60 for lunch with a group of 4.
# 
#   - Have lunch in a group of approximately 4 DUB people who all add something different
#     (e.g., different departments, different research advisors,
#     different disciplinary background, different years in their program).
#     You decide what brings different perspectives to your DUB mixers,
#     but be sure that your group is mixing across the DUB community.
# 
#   - As part of your lunch, be sure discussion includes DUB and related activities
#     (e.g., in the rest of the quarter, in the rest of the year).
#     Consider activities that you could help organize,
#     or consider other opportunities to contribute within the DUB community.
# 
#   - Send an email to speak [at] dub [dot] washington [dot] edu.
#     Let us know what you are thinking about and how we can facilitate and publicize activities.
# 
#   - Keep your receipt, including both the itemized receipt and the signed receipt with any tip.
#     We will reimburse approximately $60 for lunch with a group of 4.
#     Initiate the reimbursement process by submitting this form:
