## Can I participate in this program remotely?

No. All students in this program will need to be in the Seattle area and come to the UW Seattle campus regularly.

No. The UW Seattle campus is well connected by public transit, including buses and light rail. The UW Transportation Services website lists a number of [options](https://transportation.uw.edu/getting-here) for commuting to the campus.

## When do I get paid?

## Apart from being able to participate in conducting research, what else can I expect from this program?

We offer a range of opportunities for students to develop their research skills and knowledge. These include opportunities to attend the [DUB seminar series](https://dub.washington.edu/seminar.html), lunches with faculty members from across the campus, sessions with current graduate students, and a poster session to present and share your work with members of the DUB community. Furthermore, we value developing a community of undergraduate researchers, and encourage members of a REU cohort to self-organize social activities.
