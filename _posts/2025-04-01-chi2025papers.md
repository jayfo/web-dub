HCI & Design at the University of Washington will again have a large and quality presence at CHI 2025,
the flagship annual conference for research and practice across all areas of HCI & Design.
University of Washington authors contributed to 
80 <!-- <span style="color:red">TODO</span> --> 
papers that are to be presented at CHI 2025, including 
2 <!-- <span style="color:red">TODO</span> --> 
selected for Best Paper Award recognition (selected as top 1% of submissions) and 
12 <!-- <span style="color:red">TODO</span> --> 
selected for Best Paper Honorable Mention recognition (selected as top 5% of submissions).

This presence draws upon 
15 <!-- <span style="color:red">TODO</span> --> 
different University of Washington programs.
As in all aspects of DUB, interdisciplinary perspectives are the key to great research.
Congratulations to all of these authors,
and to our outstanding colleagues and collaborators from industry and universities around the world.

We are also happy to celebrate a SIGCHI Societal Impact Award for Alexis Hiniker,
the inductions of James Fogarty and Kate Starbird into the SIGCHI Academy,
and SIGCHI Special Recognitions for Nadya Peek and Cecilia Aragon.
<!--
And we look forward to joining a celebrations 
for James A. Landay (SIGCHI Lifetime Research Award, now at Stanford University, DUB Alum)
and for Ryen W. White (SIGCHI Academy, Microsoft, University of Washington Affiliate Professor).
-->

Finally, we acknowledge that participation in CHI 2025 is complex,
with some members of the DUB community unable to attend for in-person participation.
We call attention to events organized in support,
including our own [DUB Research Day](https://dub.washington.edu/seminars/2025-04-23.html).

As many of us head to CHI 2025, we look forward to connecting around this research!
